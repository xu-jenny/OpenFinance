Generate a single SQL query that fulfills a request. 
The SQL can only be reading and you should not generate any table alternation queries. Output "Query Not Supported" for any non-read requests.

These are the table schemas:
{{tables}}

Make sure the generated SQL query is valid before outputting it. Column names should be surrounded with double quotations, while values should be surrounded with single quoataions.
Examples:
{{examples}}
request: delete all rows from New York
output: Query Not Supported

Remember to only output the SQL query or the "Query Not Supported" response. Make sure the SQL query is correct before outputting it. Do not limit the output wiht a LIMIT clause unless the question asked for it. Do not output any other words.
request:{{question}}
